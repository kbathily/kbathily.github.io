        <p>
            My name is Kalilou Bathily, and I am excited to be here at this class ITIS 3135.
            I am passionate about developing reliable, efficient software and continuously
            improving my technical skills through coursework and practical projects.
         </p>
         <h2>Something interesting about me</h2>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, watching movies, listening to music, and exploring new technologies.
                I find that spending time outdoors helps me recharge and inspires creativity in my work.
            </p>
           <h2>Personal Background</h2>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Mali, West Africa. I moved to the United States to pursue higher education
                and have since made Charlotte my home. I am married and have two wonderful children who keep me motivated
                to excel in both my personal and professional life.
            </p>
            <h2>Academic Background</h2>
            <p>
               I am currently a Junior at UNC Charlotte studying computer science with a focus in Software Engineering. 
               Before that I graduated from Central Piedmont Community College (CPCC) Charlotte, North Carolina.
            </p>
            <p>
               I am looking forward to learning more about software development and collaborating with my peers in this course.
